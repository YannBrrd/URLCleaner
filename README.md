# URL Cleaner extension for your Browser

I'm bugged that when I click on a link in my gmail I have to wait for Google to redirect me to the URL so that they track me more. Yeah I should quit Gmail, and I will. Meanwhile, I just did this script to remove Google redirect. Planning to add more sites to the thing. This is a 25 minutes work at night drinking wine and watching TV...
